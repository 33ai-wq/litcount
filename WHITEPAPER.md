## Save & Win DeFi Pool Protocol

**Version:** 1.0

**Tagline:** *Just stake it dan get reward.*  
**About:** Becoming a Truly Rich Person

## Abstract

LitCount is a decentralized pool staking protocol built on LitVM Testnet that implements a novel "Save & Win" mechanism. Users stake a fixed amount of `$zkLTC` tokens into a communal pool, receive guaranteed base rewards for participation, and compete for a jackpot prize distributed through an on-chain random draw every 21 hours.

The protocol is designed around three core principles: **fairness** (every staker receives a reward), **excitement** (a jackpot creates engagement), and **simplicity** (single stake amount, clear rules, automatic execution).

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Traditional DeFi staking protocols often suffer from:

- **Complexity** — Users must navigate complex tokenomics, vesting schedules, and variable APRs
- **Winner-takes-all** — High-yield strategies concentrate rewards among large holders
- **Low engagement** — Passive staking generates minimal user excitement or retention
- **Unfair distribution** — Large wallets disproportionately benefit from reward mechanisms

### 1.2 Solution

LitCount introduces the "Save & Win" model — a hybrid between prize-linked savings accounts and lottery pools. Every participant:

1. Stakes a fixed, equal amount (`0.1 $zkLTC`)
2. **Automatically** receives a proportional base reward from the pool
3. Participates in a random jackpot draw for a larger prize

This ensures no participant walks away empty-handed, while the jackpot element creates meaningful engagement and word-of-mouth viral growth.

## 2. Protocol Mechanics

### 2.1 Pool Structure

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Stake Amount | 0.1 $zkLTC per user |
| Pool Duration | 21 hours |
| Draw Window | 21 minutes |
| Minimum Users | 21 participants |
| Jackpot Share | 70% of total pool |
| Staker Share | 20% of total pool (split equally) |
| Protocol Fee | 10% of total pool |

### 2.2 Save & Win Reward Formula

Given `N` participants:

```
Total Pool     = N × 0.1 zkLTC

Jackpot        = Total Pool × 70%
               = N × 0.07 zkLTC  →  1 lucky winner

Staker Reward  = (Total Pool × 20%) ÷ N  
               = 0.02 zkLTC per staker  →  everyone receives this

Protocol Fee   = Total Pool × 10%
               = N × 0.01 zkLTC  →  treasury
```

**Example with 500 participants:**

| Recipient | Formula | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Jackpot winner | 500 × 0.1 × 70% | **35 zkLTC** |
| Each staker | (500 × 0.1 × 20%) ÷ 500 | **0.02 zkLTC** |
| Protocol | 500 × 0.1 × 10% | 5 zkLTC |

Every staker receives `0.02 zkLTC` guaranteed. The lucky winner receives an additional `35 zkLTC` jackpot on top of their staker reward.

### 2.3 Pool Lifecycle

```
Phase 1 — Open Pool (21 hours)
  → Users call joinPool() and stake 0.1 $zkLTC
  → Pool accepts new participants continuously

Phase 2 — Trigger Check
  → After 21 hours, anyone calls triggerDrawPhase()

Phase 3A — Draw Phase (if ≥ 21 users)
  → Pool closes for 21 minutes
  → executeDraw() selects random winner on-chain
  → Jackpot sent to winner
  → Base reward sent to all stakers
  → Protocol fee sent to treasury
  → Pool fully resets → new cycle begins

Phase 3B — No Draw (if < 21 users)
  → Pool remains open, timer resets
  → Existing participants stay in pool
  → New users can still join
  → No funds lost, no participant removed
```

### 2.4 Minimum User Rule

The minimum of 21 participants protects the jackpot mechanism's viability. If fewer than 21 users have staked when the draw is triggered:

- No draw is executed
- No funds are moved
- All participants **remain** in the pool
- The 21-hour timer restarts
- New participants can join the ongoing pool

This rule ensures the jackpot is meaningful (minimum `21 × 0.1 × 70% = 1.47 zkLTC`) and prevents manipulation by very small participant groups.

## 3. Smart Contract Architecture

### 3.1 Contract Overview

The protocol consists of two smart contracts:

**`zkLTC.sol`** — ERC20 Testnet Token
- Standard ERC20 implementation
- Built-in faucet (10 zkLTC per claim, 24-hour cooldown)
- Admin mint for pool seeding

**`LitCountPool.sol`** — Core Pool Logic
- Pool state management
- Participant tracking
- Draw execution
- Reward distribution
- Emergency pause mechanism

### 3.2 Security Design

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Re-entrancy protection | `ReentrancyGuard` on all write functions |
| Safe token transfers | `SafeERC20` library |
| Emergency stop | `Pausable` pattern |
| Access control | `Ownable` for admin functions |
| Randomness | Pseudo-random (testnet); Chainlink VRF for mainnet |
| Emergency withdrawal | Only when contract is paused |

### 3.3 Randomness

For the testnet implementation, winner selection uses a pseudo-random function:

```solidity
uint256 randomIndex = uint256(
    keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
        block.timestamp,
        block.prevrandao,
        participants.length,
        msg.sender
    ))
) % count;
```

> **Mainnet Upgrade:** For production deployment, Chainlink VRF v2 will be integrated to provide verifiably random, manipulation-resistant winner selection.

### 3.4 Pool History

Every completed round (whether a draw was held or not) is recorded on-chain:

```solidity
struct PoolResult {
    uint256 poolId;
    address winner;
    uint256 jackpot;
    uint256 stakerRewardPerUser;
    uint256 totalParticipants;
    uint256 totalPool;
    uint256 timestamp;
    bool    drawHeld;
}
```

This creates a permanent, transparent record of all pool outcomes.

## 4. Token: $zkLTC

`$zkLTC` (zkLTC Testnet) is the native staking asset of the LitCount protocol on LitVM Testnet.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | zkLTC Testnet |
| Symbol | $zkLTC |
| Decimals | 18 |
| Type | ERC20 |
| Faucet | 10 zkLTC per 24 hours |
| Initial Supply | 1,000,000 zkLTC |

### Faucet

Any address can claim `10 $zkLTC` from the built-in faucet once every 24 hours. This allows new users to immediately participate in the pool without needing external token sources.

---

## 5. Frontend Application

The LitCount web application provides a seamless user experience for interacting with the protocol.

## 8. Risk Disclaimer

LitCount is an experimental DeFi protocol deployed on testnet. The current implementation uses pseudo-random number generation which is not suitable for mainnet without Chainlink VRF. Users should:

- Only use testnet tokens with no real monetary value
- Understand that smart contracts may contain bugs
- Not invest more than they are willing to lose on any mainnet version

---

## 9. Conclusion

LitCount demonstrates that DeFi protocols can be simultaneously **fair**, **exciting**, and **simple**. The "Save & Win" mechanism ensures:

- ✅ Every participant receives a guaranteed reward (20% share)
- ✅ An exciting jackpot creates engagement (70% prize)
- ✅ The protocol is self-sustaining (10% fee)
- ✅ Clear rules prevent confusion
- ✅ No minimum holding periods
- ✅ Transparent on-chain execution
